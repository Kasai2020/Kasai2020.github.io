I am currently a Research Engineer at Samsung AI Center NYC, where I have the privilege of contributing to innovative advancements in the field. I am proud to have multiple first author publications in prestigious computer vision conferences such as ICCV and ECCV. I hold a Master's degree in Robotics from the University of Minnesota, which has equipped me with a strong understanding in the area of computer vision and robotics.

My deep enthusiasm lies in the future of AI and robotics, as I am constantly inspired by the potential they hold. I hope to continue to explore new possibilities and pioneer novel methodologies, aiming to make notable contributions to these fields.
